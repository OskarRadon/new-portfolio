## Portfolio Site

#### Description
This is my second design for my portfolio, [click here](http://oskarradon.com) to see it for real!

#### Technologies Used

SCSS, Jade

#### To do:
- Try out having the whole portfolio thumbnail covered with titles
- Implement script to make titles(and maybe images) fade in on page load
- Try out having outer div slide up on page load (don't go overboard on animations though lol)
- Make the rest of the project pages
- Finish Scoop page for large screen sizes
- Make sure images aren't pixelated and crappy at all screen sizes
- Add link to CV and social media (maybe)
- Test for cross-browser compatability
- Continually test page load time and page size
- Make mixin for margin-top of titles on main page
