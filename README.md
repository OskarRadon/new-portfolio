## Portfolio Site

#### Description
This is my second design for my portfolio, Check out my first version [here](https://github.com/OskarRadon/Oskar-Radon-site), and [click here](http://oskarradon.com) to see the site for real!

#### Technologies Used

SCSS, Jade, probably jQuery

#### To do:
- ~~Try out having the whole portfolio thumbnail covered with titles~~
- ~~Implement script to make titles(and maybe images) fade in on page load~~
- Try out having outer div slide up on page load (don't go overboard on animations though lol)
- Make the rest of the project pages
- Finish Scoop page for large screen sizes
- Make sure images aren't pixelated and crappy at all screen sizes
- ~~Add link to CV and social media (maybe)~~
- Test for cross-browser compatability
- Continually test page load time and page size
- ~~Make mixin for margin-top of titles on main page~~
- ~~Is the mobile front page really broken or is it just Chrome?~~
- ~~Should the images be square?~~
- Alt text for everything
- Hover effect on social media icons
